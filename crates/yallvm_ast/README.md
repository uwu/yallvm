# yallvm AST

This crate contains the AST data structures used for yallvm's tooling.

It also is the place to implement tools such as visitors and AST related utilities,
but not specifically any transforms that the compiler performs.

Important and AST-wide design choices to be aware of:
 - References to AST nodes which aren't specific (e.g. `Expr`, `Stmt`) are almost always
   `Box`ed to avoid storing the entire AST on the stack (impractical!),
   though this is not a huge performance win, because unlike using `Rc`,
   `clone()`ing the AST will still clone children of the node.
 - All node structs have a `span` field which provides the byte positions and line number of
   every AST node. These are used to provide useful error messages to the compiler.
 - All node structs implement `Clone`, and `Span` implements `Default`.
 - All nodes provide a `to_box()` method that allows boxing from postfix, for ease of use
 - Same for `to_enum()` for nodes in a relevant enum (`DeclStmt` â†’ `Stmt::Decl()` etc.)
 - All string literals are `String`s
 - All collections are `Vec`s
 - Types are generally called `type_` in nodes, as `type` is a keyword in Rust. Same for some others.
 - Most nodes that are functions (arrows, methods, functions, operators, constructors) use the
   `FuncCommon` type to store all the common properties together, to reduce duplication.
